## DOOM.rs: A Rust Implementation of DOOM

---

### Features

This implementation replicates key features of the original DOOM engine:

- Rendering of 2.5D environments using a BSP-based level structure.
- Full support for WAD files to load original DOOM assets and levels.
- Sprite-based rendering for enemies, items, and weapons.
- Physics simulation for movement, collision detection, and projectiles.
- Audio playback for both music and sound effects.
- AI for enemy behaviors, pathfinding, and attack patterns.
- Experimental networked multiplayer support (work-in-progress).
- Modular architecture for customization and modern enhancements.

### Requirements

To build and run DOOM.rs, the following are required:

- **Rust**: A stable version of the Rust compiler and Cargo.
- **SDL2**: For windowing, input handling, and audio playback.
- **WAD Files**: The original DOOM or DOOM II WAD files are necessary to load assets and levels.

You can install SDL2 via your system's package manager or from [SDL2's official website](https://www.libsdl.org/).

---

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

   Ensure Rust and Cargo are installed. Use your systemâ€™s package manager or manual installation to set up SDL2.

2. Build the project:

   ```
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. Run the game with a WAD file:

   ```
   cargo run --release -- --wad path/to/doom.wad
   ```

Replace `path/to/doom.wad` with the path to a valid WAD file.

---

### Usage

You can pass the following runtime options to the executable:

- `--wad <path>`: Specifies the WAD file to load (required).
- `--fullscreen`: Runs the game in fullscreen mode.
- `--resolution <width>x<height>`: Sets a custom resolution.
- `--debug`: Enables debug rendering and logging.

Example command:

```
cargo run --release -- --wad ./DOOM.WAD --fullscreen --resolution 1920x1080
```

---

### Controls

- **WASD**: Move forward/backward and strafe.
- **Arrow Keys**: Turn or strafe (alternative).
- **Space**: Interact with doors, switches, and other objects.
- **Ctrl**: Shoot weapon.
- **Shift**: Sprint.
- **ESC**: Pause the game or quit.

---

### Project Structure

The project is organized into modular subsystems for clarity and scalability:

- **`engine/`**: Core game engine logic, including physics, input handling, and event systems.
- **`renderer/`**: Implements BSP traversal, raycasting, and sprite-based rendering.
- **`wad/`**: Responsible for parsing WAD files and extracting level, texture, and sprite data.
- **`audio/`**: Handles sound effects and music playback using a Rust audio backend.
- **`game/`**: Manages player mechanics, enemy AI, and game state transitions.
- **`network/`**: (Optional) Implements experimental networked multiplayer logic.
- **`util/`**: Shared utilities such as random number generators and lookup tables.
